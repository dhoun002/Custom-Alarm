# Custom-Alarm

The timer runs on a 24 hour system. The timer ticks every second and the user can set the time for hour and minutes.
The user can also set an alarm that triggers when the hours and minutes match the current time. There is also a 
snooze button that increases the alarm time by ten.

The controls are A for setting alarm, B for setting time, C for stopping alarm, and D for setting up snooze. The respective
numbers are used while setting alarm and time.

The atmega1284 microcontroller is the center of the design with a LCD display to show the time and a keypad to perform the
actions. A buzzer is used to wake up the user. A power supply is linked with the breadboard.
